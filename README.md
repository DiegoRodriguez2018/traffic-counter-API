# Traffic Counter API
### Description
As described on the [specifications](./Specifications.md), the main objective of this project is to create a REST API that handles automated traffic controller data. The data will be originally stored in a .txt file. The program will read this file, extract the information required and perform a series of calculations. 

As required in the specifications, this project will consist of two REST APIs. The first one will output the result of the previous calculations in separate endpoints, and the second one will output all the results in one endpoint.
